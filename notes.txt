We do have a variety of premade designs that you can pick from or you can bring in your own. We just can't create a brand new design for you.

How long will it take for my order to be completed?
We are first come, first serve so the timeline can change. But 1 - 4 shirts usually takes 2 - 3 days and 5 - 10 shirts will usually take 4 - 5 days. White shirts will also print the fastest.

Can I bring in my own shirt?
You can, but there is a $7 bring in fee for any outside items. There are also no replacements or reimbursements if there are any errors since we can't guarantee how well the design will print.

Yep! It costs the same no matter if you get the shirt vinyled or printed.

We don't charge by the color, just the size of the design. So your design can be as colorful or complex as you want.

Can I print on the front and the back?
Yes, you will just have to pay for ink for the front and back.
